## Documentation
This repository is still under construction. I'm still working on creating scripts (Bash and Python mainly) that I use to automate 
certain tasks. I will update this repository frequently with new scripts and new documentation. 

In the near future, you can expect to see a Wiki for this repository to document what a script does and how it's used. For the mean
time everything will be documented below.

# init_env.sh
This is a script I use to setup my hacking environment, on Kali Linux.
